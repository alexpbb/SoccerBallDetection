# SoccerBallDetection
This is a project in which I trained a pre-trained model to detect a soccer ball from images and video capture. I was inspired to create this project because I had an interest in machine learning and computer vision, but I wanted to see the scope in which these concepts could be implemented in the real world. I am really into watching soccer, especially the Premier League, and one of the most controversial issues at this time for the sport is the use of the Video Assistance Referee (VAR). This system was implemented to increase the fairness and equity of the game, but many have complained about its legitimacy and how it hinders the sport. Due to these recent controversies and my passion for machine learning, I wanted to see if I could create the foundation of what could potentially be a replica of the VAR system by first training and deploying a soccer ball detection model. 

I found a GitHub repository that went into detail about the basics of machine learning and computer vision. I used the resources in the repo to get a better understanding and foundation for the project I had in mind.

For this project, I worked with Python, JupyterNotebook, Colab, TensorFlow, OpenCV, and other Python dependencies. I had issues with JupyterNotebook when it came to running the training script for the model which led to me switching to Colab to train it. I used an SSD MobileNet pre-trained model obtained from the TensorFlow Model Zoo. I used a dataset of 26 images; 20 of which were used for training and the other 6 for testing. When running the training script, I configured the pipeline to be 5000 steps with a batch size of 10. With these settings, I obtained an average mAP of 56.25%.
